Just a small project where I practice DOM manipulation, media-queries, Flexbox, SASS, and Fetch API.

I found starter code for pop ups (I believe from W3 schools) and added to it. I also thought this would be a good opportunity to practice some Flexbox skills.

Added SASS to the project and started with variables. 

Added SASS nesting to the project.

Added SASS mixins to the project.

Added SASS partials to the project.
  -main: where all the imports go
  -mixins: added mixins to the artists.scss
  -base: base styles
  -artists: artists modules
  -variables: where I declare my variables
  -normalize: https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
    Normalize.css renders styles more consistently among browsers 

npm run compile:sass 

Taught myself Fetch API and fetched some JSON data from the News API. The parameters I used was all sources (everything), Chillwave music (q = indie music), and am trying to limit 5 results at a time (totalResults=5) but I can't get that one to work. Needs a lot of styling love and SASS updates.
