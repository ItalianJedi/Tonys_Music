Just a small project where I practice DOM manipulation and Flexbox.

I found starter code for pop ups (I believe from W3 schools) and added to it. I also thought this would be a good opportunity to practice some Flexbox skills.

Other than adding more artists to this page and playing around with the design I am kind of at a loss as to what else to do with it.
