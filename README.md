Just a small project where I practice DOM manipulation, Flexbox, and SASS.

I found starter code for pop ups (I believe from W3 schools) and added to it. I also thought this would be a good opportunity to practice some Flexbox skills.

Added SASS to the project and started with variables. 

Added SASS nesting to the project.

Added SASS partials to the project.
  -main: where all the imports go
  -base: base styles
  -artists: artists modules
  -variables: where I declare my variables
  -normalize: https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
    Normalize.css renders styles more consistently among browsers
