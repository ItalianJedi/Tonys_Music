Just a small project where I practice DOM manipulation and Flexbox.

I found starter code for pop ups (I believe from W3 schools) and added to it. I also thought this would be a good opportunity to practice some Flexbox skills.

Added SASS to the project and started with variables. Need to rewrite a little bit of the HTML so I can utilize SASS nesting.
