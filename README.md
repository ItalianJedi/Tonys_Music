Just a small project where I practice DOM manipulation and Flexbox.

I found starter code for pop ups (I believe from W3 schools) and added to it. I also thought this would be a good opportunity to practice some Flexbox skills.

I am going to do some practice with SASS in this project. Just downloaded SASS through NPM.
